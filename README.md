- [Advanced CS](#advanced-cs) assumes the student has already taken the entirety of Core CS
and is knowledgeable enough now to decide which electives to take.

## Final project

OSS University is project-focused.
The assignments and exams for each course are to prepare you to use your knowledge to solve real-world problems.

After you've gotten through all of Core CS and the parts of Advanced CS relevant to you, you should think about a problem that you can solve using the knowledge you've acquired.
Not only does real project work look great on a resume, but the project will also validate and consolidate your knowledge.
You can create something entirely new, or you can find an existing project that needs help via websites like
[CodeTriage](https://www.codetriage.com/)
or
[First Timers Only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/).

Students who would like more guidance in creating a project may choose to use a series of project oriented courses. Here is a sample of options (many more are available, at this point you should be capable of identifying a series that is interesting and relevant to you):

Courses | Duration | Effort | Prerequisites
:-- | :--: | :--: | :--:
[Fullstack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) | 12 weeks | 15 hours/week | programming
[Modern Robotics (Specialization)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/modernrobotics) | 26 weeks | 2-5 hours/week | freshman-level physics, linear algebra, calculus, [linear ordinary differential equations](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/differential-equations)
[Data Mining (Specialization)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-mining) | 30 weeks | 2-5 hours/week | machine learning
[Big Data (Specialization)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/big-data) | 30 weeks | 3-5 hours/week | none
[Internet of Things (Specialization)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/internet-of-things) | 30 weeks | 1-5 hours/week | strong programming
[Cloud Computing (Specialization)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/cloud-computing) | 30 weeks | 2-6 hours/week | C++ programming
[Data Science (Specialization)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) | 43 weeks | 1-6 hours/week | none
[Functional Programming in Scala (Specialization)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/scala) | 29 weeks | 4-5 hours/week | One year programming experience
[Game Design and Development with Unity 2020 (Specialization)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/game-design-and-development) | 6 months | 5 hours/week | programming, interactive design

### Evaluation

Upon completing your final project:
- Submit your project's information to [PROJECTS](PROJECTS.md) via a pull request.
- Put the OSSU-CS badge in the README of your repository!
[![Open Source Society University - Computer Science](https://img.shields.io/badge/OSSU-computer--science-blue.svg)](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science)

  - Markdown: `[![Open Source Society University - Computer Science](https://img.shields.io/badge/OSSU-computer--science-blue.svg)](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science)`
  - HTML: `<a href="https://github.com/ossu/computer-science"><img alt="Open Source Society University - Computer Science" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/OSSU-computer--science-blue.svg"></a>`
- Use our [community](#community) channels to announce it to your fellow students.

Solicit feedback from your OSSU peers.
You will not be "graded" in the traditional sense — everyone has their own measurements for what they consider a success.
The purpose of the evaluation is to act as your first announcement to the world that you are a computer scientist
and to get experience listening to feedback — both positive and negative.

The final project evaluation has a second purpose: to evaluate whether OSSU,
through its community and curriculum, is successful in its mission to guide independent learners in obtaining a world-class computer science education.

### Cooperative work

You can create this project alone or with other students!
**We love cooperative work**!
Use our [channels](#community) to communicate with other fellows to combine and create new projects!

### Which programming languages should I use?

My friend, here is the best part of liberty!
You can use **any** language that you want to complete the final project.

The important thing is to **internalize** the core concepts and to be able to use them with whatever tool (programming language) that you wish.

## Congratulations

After completing the requirements of the curriculum above, you will have completed the equivalent of a full bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Congratulations!

What is next for you? The possibilities are boundless and overlapping:

- Look for a job as a developer!
- Check out the [readings](extras/readings.md) for classic books you can read that will sharpen your skills and expand your knowledge.
- Join a local developer meetup (e.g. via [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/)).
- Pay attention to emerging technologies in the world of software development:
  + Explore the **actor model** through [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/), a new functional programming language for the web based on the battle-tested Erlang Virtual Machine!
  + Explore **borrowing and lifetimes** through [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), a systems language which achieves memory- and thread-safety without a garbage collector!
  + Explore **dependent type systems** through [Idris](https://www.idris-lang.org/), a new Haskell-inspired language with unprecedented support for type-driven development.

# Code of conduct
[OSSU's code of conduct](https://github.com/ossu/code-of-conduct).

## How to show your progress

1. Create an account in [Trello](https://trello.com/).
1. Copy [this](https://trello.com/b/IScNSzsI/ossu-compsci) board to your personal account.
See how to copy a board [here](https://help.trello.com/article/802-copying-cards-lists-or-boards).

Now that you have a copy of our official board, you just need to pass the cards to the `Doing` column or `Done` column as you progress in your study.

We also have **labels** to help you have more control through the process.
The meaning of each of these labels is:

- `Main Curriculum`: cards with that label represent courses that are listed in our curriculum.
- `Extra Resources`: cards with that label represent courses that were added by the student.
- `Doing`: cards with that label represent courses the student is currently doing.
- `Done`: cards with that label represent courses finished by the student.
Those cards should also have the link for at least one project/article built with the knowledge acquired in such a course.
- `Section`: cards with that label represent the section that we have in our curriculum.
Those cards with the `Section` label are only to help the organization of the Done column.
You should put the *Course's cards* below its respective *Section's card*.

The intention of this board is to provide our students a way to track their progress, and also the ability to show their progress through a public page for friends, family, employers, etc.
You can change the status of your board to be *public* or *private*.
